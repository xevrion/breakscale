/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * Cloud vendor mode.
 *
 * A student learning system design meets "load balancer" first and "ALB"
 * second, which is the right order: the concept survives a decade, the
 * product name does not. Generic therefore stays the default, and a vendor
 * is something you switch on once the idea has landed.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DATA IS, AND IS NOT.
 *
 * Everything in the vendor files beside this one is PUBLISHED SPEC: a vCPU
 * count, a memory figure, a price, each with the URL it came from and the
 * date it was read. Those are facts, and AGENTS.md requires them to be
 * true.
 *
 * What is NOT a fact is how a vCPU count becomes the engine's `capacity`
 * and `serviceMs`. No vendor publishes "this instance serves N concurrent
 * requests at M milliseconds", because the answer depends entirely on what
 * the software is doing. Any mapping is a MODEL, and this project's whole
 * point is to not dress a model up as a measurement.
 *
 * So the two are kept apart on purpose. Specs are cited. The derivation
 * lives in one documented function, is labelled as derived wherever it is
 * shown, and a reader who wants the real behaviour is told to set the
 * knobs themselves.
