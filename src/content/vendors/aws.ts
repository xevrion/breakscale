/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * AWS product names and published instance specs.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS.
 *
 * Published spec data, and nothing else. Every vCPU count, memory figure,
 * network string and price below was read from an AWS page or from the AWS
 * Price List API, and carries the URL it came from. Prices carry the date
 * they were read, because they change and a stale number that does not say
 * so is worse than no number.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT.
 *
 * It is not the mapping from these specs to simulator behaviour. Nothing
 * here says how a vCPU count becomes `capacity` or `serviceMs`; that is a
 * model, it lives in `derive.ts`, and it is labelled as derived wherever it
 * is shown. See the header of `types.ts` for why the two are kept apart.
 *
 * ON MISSING FIELDS.
 *
 * Several fields a reader might expect are absent, deliberately. AGENTS.md
 * says a component with no meaningful value shows nothing rather than a
 * plausible-looking number, and that applies here first. The three gaps
 * worth knowing about:
 *
 * 1. `maxIops` is absent from every EC2 and RDS size. AWS does not publish
 *    max IOPS per instance class. It publishes it per EBS VOLUME TYPE and
 *    per storage size, and the instance class applies a separate ceiling on
 *    top. See RDS_STORAGE_IOPS below for the figures that ARE published,
 *    kept out of the size records because they do not belong to a size.
 *
 * 2. `maxConnections` is absent from every RDS size. AWS publishes a
 *    FORMULA, not a number: PostgreSQL is
 *    `LEAST({DBInstanceClassMemory/9531392}, 5000)`. `DBInstanceClassMemory`
 *    is not the instance's GiB figure, it is that minus an unpublished
 *    reservation for the OS and RDS processes, and the docs show the
 *    difference is real: for 8 GiB, the naive arithmetic gives 683 while
 *    the actual value is about 630. Computing it here would produce exactly
 *    the confident wrong number this project forbids.
 *
 * 3. `maxConnections` IS present on the ElastiCache sizes, because there
 *    AWS publishes a literal per-node-type default for `maxclients`, and it
 *    genuinely differs between node types.
 *
 * ON "UP TO".
 *
 * The `network` strings are copied verbatim and most of them begin "Up to".
 * That wording is load-bearing: it is a burst ceiling, not a sustained
 * rate. Smaller sizes hold a much lower baseline and burst above it only on
 * credit. AWS publishes the baseline separately in its network specs table
 * (m6i.large, for instance, is "0.781 / 12.5" baseline/burst Gbps), so a
 * reader who treats the "Up to 12.5" as a steady figure is off by about
 * sixteen times. The strings are kept as text so that ceiling cannot be
 * silently rounded into a promise.
