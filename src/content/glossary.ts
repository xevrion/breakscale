/**
 * Plain-language explanations for every term the interface puts in front of a
 * student.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for both the hover/focus tooltips and the
 * glossary panel, so a term is never explained two different ways in two
 * places.
 *
 * House style for an entry, learned from watching people read this app:
 *   - `short` is what fits in a tooltip header and on a narrow screen. One
 *     line, no jargon, no trailing period.
 *   - `why` is the part that actually teaches. A metric a student cannot act
 *     on is trivia, so say what it tells them and what to do about it.
 *   - Never define a term using another undefined term. Where one entry leans
 *     on another, name it in `see` so the reader can follow the thread.
 *   - Address the reader as "you". Prefer "the slowest 1% of requests" over
 *     "the 99th percentile of the latency distribution".
