/**
 * Deep-link boot parameters.
 *
 * The app had no entry point for "open this example": presets came from
 * localStorage or a share link, so there was nothing to navigate to. These
 * parameters are read once at boot, before the first paint:
 *
 *   ?preset=<preset id>       load that example instead of the stored session
 *   ?theme=light|dark|system  override the theme for this page view
 *   ?paused=1                 boot with the simulation frozen
 *   ?warmup=<ms>              advance the simulation deterministically before
 *                             the first paint, capped at one minute
 *
 * `theme` is also read from the hash (`#theme=dark`), which is where a human
 * pasting a link tends to put it; the query wins when both are present. The
 * hash is otherwise share-link territory (the versioned d1./d2./d3.
 * prefixes) and is left alone: those payloads contain no "=" parameters,
 * so parsing them is a no-op by construction.
 *
 * Pure string parsing, so it unit-tests without a DOM. Anything malformed
 * costs only that one parameter; an unknown preset or theme boots the
 * stored session rather than an error page, exactly like a corrupt
 * localStorage value does.
