/**
 * Presence wrapper for one collapsible shell panel.
 *
 * THE STRUCTURAL FIX for panel motion. The shell used to render each panel
 * conditionally, so a closing panel was out of the DOM a frame before any
 * transition could run; there was literally nothing left to animate. This
 * wrapper keeps the panel mounted through its exit (usePresence), and the
 * panel slides from its own edge via TRANSFORM keyframes in App.css.
 *
 * Why transform, not an animated width or grid track: the canvas's
 * world-to-screen maths reads its viewport rect, so a layout that changes on
 * every animation frame would make an in-progress node drag drift and force
 * a re-fit per frame. The slots are absolutely positioned OVER the stage
 * (App.css), so in fact no state of this animation, and not even the slot's
 * mount or unmount, can change the canvas's rect: the diagram holds the same
 * screen pixels through any toggle, including one mid-drag, and the slide is
 * a pure transform that invalidates no layout at all.
 *
 * While closing the slot is `inert`: the leaving panel cannot take focus and
 * is invisible to a screen reader, and at animationend it unmounts outright,
 * so nothing hidden lingers in the DOM and an idle shell pays nothing.
 *
 * Children are FROZEN during the exit: the last element rendered while open
 * keeps rendering until unmount. The inspector needs this, because the
 * selection that justified its content is often already gone by the time it
 * slides out, and re-rendering it empty mid-exit would flash a blank panel.
 *
 * The entrance animation is skipped on the slot's very first appearance at
 * app boot (a panel restored from the saved layout is simply present, and
 * content that is simply present does not get an entrance), and plays on
 * every toggle after that.
