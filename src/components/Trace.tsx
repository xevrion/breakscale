/* ==========================================================================
   One request, hop by hop, split into waiting and working.

   WHY IT EXISTS. Every other reading in this app is an aggregate: a rate, a
   percentile, a mean. Those say latency ROSE. None of them say WHERE it
   went, and a student watching p99 climb from 40ms to 400ms has no way to
   tell whether the work got slower or whether the request simply stood in a
   line. Under load it is almost always the line, and that is the single most
   important thing this simulator has to teach.

   So: one real request, not a statistic. An average of queueing is less
   convincing than one honest example of it, and a student can point at a bar
   and say "that node is where my request waited".

   The two bars are the whole design. Service barely moves as load rises;
   queued grows without bound. Putting them side by side on one row, at one
   scale, makes that comparison automatic rather than arithmetic.
