/* ==========================================================================
   Explanation tooltips.

   The native `title` attribute is not good enough for a teaching tool. It
   waits about a second, cannot be styled, never appears for keyboard users,
   and does nothing at all on a touch screen. Every one of those matters when
   the entire point is that a confused student can find out what a word means.

   ARCHITECTURE: ONE OVERLAY, MANY CHEAP TRIGGERS.

   The obvious build — each <Term> owns its own useState, refs, timers and
   portal — is the wrong one here. This app re-renders its whole readout tree
   ten times a second while the simulation runs, and a screen carries dozens
   of terms. Paying for six hooks and a subscription per term, sixty times a
   second, to service the ONE tooltip that can be open at a time, is waste
   that shows up as jank on the machines students actually use.

   So the state lives in a module-level controller instead. A <Term> is a
   plain <span> with event handlers: no state, no effects, no refs, no id
   generation, nothing to reconcile beyond its own children. Its handlers are
   stable module functions, so React sees identical props across re-renders.
   Exactly one <TooltipLayer/> subscribes to the controller and renders the
   single open panel. Real work is proportional to tooltips OPEN, not to
   tooltips PRESENT.

   The trigger keeps its own identity in `data-term`, which the controller
   reads back off the DOM. That is what lets the trigger stay stateless.
