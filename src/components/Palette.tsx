 * Fourteen kinds and thirteen presets in a 224px rail is 27 rows. Listed
 * flat that is a 1100px column: a wall of text that must be scrolled to
 * be read, which means the student cannot see what the app offers.
 *
 * The fix is GROUPING, not shrinking. The groups themselves are
 * KIND_GROUPS in nodeVisuals.ts, shared with the canvas ledger; what the
 * rail adds is the rendering.
 *
 * Sections collapse, and the open/closed state is local UI state that
 * the shell does not need to know about. Components stay open by
 * default because that is the rail's primary job; Examples too, since
 * that is how a student starts. Keys is closed — it is a reference, not
 * a task.

                    Here that is wrong, and the reason is what the row DOES:
                    clicking it puts a component on the canvas. Making the
                    name a tooltip trigger would nest one interactive element
                    inside another, and worse, it would mean the gesture for
                    "what IS a circuit breaker?" and the gesture for "give me
                    a circuit breaker" are the same click. A student browsing
                    to learn would litter the canvas doing it.

                    So the trigger is a SIBLING of the button, not a child.
                    The row keeps its click, its drag and its keyboard
                    activation exactly as they were; the mark beside it
                    explains. Hovering anywhere on the row reveals the mark,
                    so it is discoverable without being 33 permanent dots.
