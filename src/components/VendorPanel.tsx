/* ==========================================================================
   What this component is called at the chosen vendor, and how big it is.

   Only rendered when a vendor is chosen. On generic it is absent entirely
   rather than empty, because a student learning what a load balancer IS
   should not have a panel asking them to pick an instance class for it.

   THE HONESTY RULE. Every spec shown here is published and linked. The
   capacity a size implies is NOT published by anyone, so it is labelled as
   ours wherever it appears. That labelling is the feature; without it this
   panel would be the app quietly inventing numbers, which is the exact
   thing it exists to argue against.
