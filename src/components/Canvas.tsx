 *                   preset exists to teach starts to crowd.
 *   async-workers   api(260) -> queue(500) is the tightest horizontal pair:

 * canvas used to throw away. Each is memoised separately from the node body
 * so that a node whose structure did not change this frame does not re-render
 * its units just because its p99 moved.
 *
 * The shared rule for all four: EVERY element they emit is
 * `pointer-events: none` (set in Canvas.css on `.cv-units`, `.cv-strip`,
 * `.cv-vessel` and their children). They are decoration painted inside the
 * node group, and the node group already carries the `data-hit="node"` that
 * the pointer router reads. If any of these could take a pointer, a press on
 * a shard cell would resolve to the cell rather than to the node, and
 * `closest('[data-hit]')` would still find the node — but the extra elements
 * would sit above the ports' 15px hit discs and eat link gestures near the
 * node's edges. Making them inert is what keeps the input layer untouched.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * Input layer
 *
 * ONE pointerdown router lives on `.cv-surface`, an element that contains the
 * SVG and nothing else. Every piece of overlay chrome (zoom controls, ledger,
 * empty-state copy) is a SIBLING of the surface, not a descendant, so a press
 * on a button can never reach this code and can never be swallowed by pointer
 * capture. That is the structural half of the fix; the router also bails on
 * anything matching `button, input, select, textarea, a, [data-chrome]` as a
 * belt-and-braces second half.
 *
 * The state machine has two phases:
 *
 *   PENDING   pointerdown recorded what was hit and where, and NOTHING else.
 *             No capture, no state change, no selection change. A release in
 *             this phase is a CLICK and is routed by what was hit.
 *
 *   ACTIVE    the pointer travelled more than DRAG_THRESHOLD screen px, so
 *             the gesture is promoted to the drag its hit target implies and
 *             the pointer is captured at that moment — never earlier.
 *
 * `pendingLink` is a third, modeless state: a completed click on an output
 * port arms a link that the NEXT click completes. That gives beginners a
 * two-click alternative to a precise drag.

          not look like a button, so somebody who had panned into empty space
          had no visible way back and the honest answer was a keyboard
          shortcut they had not been told about. A labelled icon costs one
          slot and removes the only way to get properly lost.
