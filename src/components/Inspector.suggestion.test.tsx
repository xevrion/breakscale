 * only prove the strings; it cannot prove a node ever shows one, nor that a
 * healthy node stays quiet. These render the real panel and read the DOM.
 *
 * Every kind is driven from KIND_NAME rather than a list copied out of
 * Inspector.tsx. A copied list rots silently: add a kind to
 * HAS_THROUGHPUT_CEILING with no suggestion written for it and a hardcoded
 * list would never mention it. Here the ceiling readout and the suggestion
 * are asserted to appear together, so that case fails.
