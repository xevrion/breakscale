 * Saving a design to a file, and reading one back.
 *
 * A share link carries a design between two browsers; a file carries it
 * between two people, or between today and a laptop that will be
 * reformatted before the term ends. The two want the same care and the
 * same validation, so this module is the file half of that story: build
 * the bytes, hand them to the browser as a download, and treat anything
 * that comes back in through the file picker as hostile until every field
 * has been checked.
 *
 * The parse half is pure data-in data-out and never touches the DOM, so
 * the whole trust boundary is unit testable without a browser. Only
 * `downloadDesign` and `readDesignFile` need one.
