/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * Undo / redo for the shell.
 *
 * FULL SNAPSHOTS, NOT DELTAS. The topology is a few dozen plain-data nodes,
 * so a complete copy of `{ topology, selectedIds, rps, presetId }` per entry
 * is a few kilobytes. Excalidraw's delta machinery exists for multiplayer
 * reconciliation, which this app does not have; snapshots are the version
 * that is obviously correct.
 *
 * The semantics worth copying from Excalidraw's rebuilt history:
 *
 *   1. ONE ENTRY PER GESTURE. A drag commits at pointerup, a streamed edit
 *      (slider frames, rename keystrokes, arrow nudges) commits once it
 *      settles, never once per frame.
 *   2. SELECTION TRAVELS WITH HISTORY, but a selection-only change never
 *      clears the redo stack. Selection changes simply do not touch this
 *      class; each committed entry captures the selection as of commit time,
 *      so undo restores it for free.
 *   3. NO-OP ENTRIES ARE SKIPPED. If applying an entry would change nothing
 *      visible, undo/redo keeps popping rather than burning a keypress.
 *   4. canUndo / canRedo ARE DERIVED from the stacks on every read, never
 *      cached as separate booleans that can go stale.
