/**
 * Component behaviour registry.
 *
 * Every kind-specific decision the event loop needs to make lives here, in one
 * object per NodeKind. The engine itself is kind-agnostic: it resolves a node's
 * behaviour once, at buildNodes() time, into a direct object reference on the
 * node's runtime state, and from then on the hot path only ever calls methods
 * through that reference -- never a map lookup, never a `kind === ...` test.
 *
 * Adding a new component kind is therefore: add the name to NodeKind, add a
 * defaultConfig entry, and add one behaviour object to BEHAVIOURS below. No
 * edit to the event loop.
 *
 * The `ctx` argument is the engine, narrowed to the small surface a behaviour
 * is allowed to touch (BehaviourCtx). Keeping it an interface rather than the
 * Engine class both documents that surface and stops a behaviour reaching into
 * scheduling internals it has no business knowing about.
