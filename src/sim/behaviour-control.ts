/**
 * Control-plane component behaviours: autoscaler, region.
 *
 * These two are different in kind from everything else in the registry. A
 * service, a cache, a queue are all things a request passes THROUGH. These are
 * things that act ON the topology: an autoscaler writes another node's
 * capacity, a region node decides which downstream is allowed to exist right
 * now. They are the control plane, and grouping them says so.
 *
 * Both are plain ComponentBehaviour objects. The event loop has no idea they
 * exist and neither added a conditional to engine.ts.
 *
 * A note on determinism, which shapes both. `advance(dt)` is driven by
 * wall-clock frames, so dt varies frame to frame. Anything asking "has enough
 * time passed?" must compare *simulated timestamps* rather than accumulate
 * per-tick deltas, or the same seed yields different results at a different
 * frame rate. That is why the autoscaler stores `lastDecisionMs` and
 * `warmupDueMs` as absolute simulated times and ignores its own `dtMs`
 * argument entirely, and why the region node's failover deadline is an
 * absolute time evaluated lazily when a request arrives.
 *
 * Neither behaviour draws from the RNG. A controller that consumed random
 * numbers would shift the shared random stream for every other node depending
 * on how often it happened to act, which is exactly the kind of coupling that
 * makes a "deterministic" simulator quietly non-reproducible.

 * one. Once per `cooldownMs` it compares the watched node's utilisation
 * against `targetUtil` and steps its instance count by `scaleStepPct`,
 * clamped to [minCapacity, maxCapacity] instances.
 *
 * WHAT IT WRITES, AND WHY THAT CHANGED. It used to write the watched node's
 * `capacity` -- its thread count. That was numerically fine and pedagogically
 * useless: "traffic went up so we added threads" is not the sentence anyone
 * means, and because nothing on the canvas counted threads, the controller
 * appeared to do nothing at all. It now writes `instances`, so the drawn
 * stack of machines grows by exactly the number of machines it decided to
 * add. `capacity` -- how big one machine is -- belongs to the student and the
 * controller never touches it.
 *
 * The teaching point is the lag. A scale-UP does not take effect until
 * `warmupMs` after the decision -- machines boot, images pull, JITs warm --
 * so a student who steps the load up watches utilisation pin at 1.0, and the
 * queue build behind it, for a visible interval before capacity answers. And
 * because the controller reacts to a utilisation its own past decisions
 * caused, a short cooldown against a long warmup makes it overshoot and
 * oscillate. That is a real failure mode, and being able to reproduce it on
 * purpose is worth more than a controller that always behaves.
 *
 * Scale-DOWN is immediate, as it is in reality: releasing a machine needs no
 * warm-up. This asymmetry is deliberate and is itself part of why autoscalers
 * oscillate downward faster than they recover.
