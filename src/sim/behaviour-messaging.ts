/**
 * Messaging and coordination component behaviours: streambroker, pubsub,
 * websocket, apigateway, sidecar, lambda, cron.
 *
 * These are the kinds real systems are glued together with: the partitioned
 * log between services, the fan-out topic, the long-lived connection
 * gateway, the front door, the per-service proxy, the function that scales
 * itself, and the batch job that arrives on a clock. Grouped in one module
 * because they share a theme a student can name; "how do services talk to
 * each other when it is not one request calling one server".
 *
 * Every one of them is a plain ComponentBehaviour: the event loop has no
 * idea they exist and none of them added a conditional to engine.ts. Three
 * of them (streambroker, pubsub, cron) ORIGINATE traffic of their own, which
 * they do through ctx.emitDetached(): a detached message that books its
 * arrivals and completions at the nodes it visits and is never waited on
 * upstream, exactly like a queue message drained by a worker.
 *
 * Determinism notes, which constrain everything here:
 *  - No behaviour in this module draws from the RNG except the apigateway's
 *    auth roll, which is taken in a fixed position at admission and only
 *    when authFailRate > 0 (the same conditional-on-config pattern the
 *    engine's own errorRate roll uses).
 *  - Anything asking "has enough time passed?" compares simulated
 *    timestamps, never accumulated per-tick deltas.
 *  - The cron fires from onTick, which quantises its firing instant to the
 *    advance() boundary; that is the same latitude the autoscaler already
 *    takes for its decisions, and the fire time is derived from simulated
 *    time, so a given advance() pattern replays exactly.
 *  - Connection and warm-pool expiries are processed LAZILY at admission by
 *    comparing stored absolute expiry times against ctx.now, so an
 *    admission decision never depends on whether a tick happened to run.

/**
 * WHY THIS IS NOT THE QUEUE. The simple `queue` is one FIFO with one set of
 * competing consumers: a message is taken once and gone. A log is different
 * in every way that matters:
 *
 *  - PARTITIONED: a message lands in `key % partitions`, and order is
 *    preserved per partition, so one consumer group can process at most
 *    `partitions` messages in parallel. Partition count, not consumer
 *    count, is the parallelism ceiling; that is the single most
 *    misunderstood fact about Kafka and it falls straight out of this
 *    model.
 *  - MULTI-READER: every outgoing edge is an independent CONSUMER GROUP
 *    with its own cursor over the same messages. A slow analytics group
 *    falls behind without costing the billing group anything.
 *  - LAG, NOT BACKPRESSURE: producers are acked immediately no matter how
 *    far behind the consumers are. The cost of a slow consumer is invisible
 *    to the producer and shows up only as CONSUMER LAG, the headline
 *    metric here.
 *  - BOUNDED BY RETENTION: `queueLimit` is the log's retention in
 *    messages. A group that falls further behind than that skips forward
 *    and the skipped messages are simply lost to it; nonzero
 *    `retentionDropRate` means "you are not just slow, you are losing
 *    data".

 * sidecar -- the per-service proxy, and what it costs

/**
 * WHY 'sidecar' AND NOT 'serviceMesh'. A mesh is a property of the whole
 * graph -- every hop proxied -- and this simulator's unit of composition is
 * the NODE. A sidecar maps one-to-one onto that: the student places one
 * proxy in front of one service, and builds a mesh the way a mesh is
 * actually built, by putting a sidecar at every hop and watching the
 * latency taxes stack. A single 'serviceMesh' node would have to act on
 * edges it does not own, which is exactly the shape the behaviour registry
 * exists to avoid.
 *
 * What it teaches: infrastructure is never free. The proxy charges its
 * serviceMs on every single request in exchange for retries
 * (config.retries, run by the engine's own retry machinery), outlier
 * ejection (a consecutive-failure circuit, simpler than the breaker's
 * windowed rate on purpose; Envoy ships exactly this policy), and
 * observability (its readouts are the upstream's health, seen from the
 * caller's side). Put a sidecar at every hop of a five-hop chain and the
 * p50 grows by five taxes; remove them and lose the retries that were
 * hiding the flaky dependency. Both runs are one checkbox apart, and the
 * comparison is the lesson.
