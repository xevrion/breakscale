/**
 * Storage behaviours: relational database, object storage, search index,
 * time-series store, graph database, cold storage, vector database.
 *
 * All seven are pure registry entries -- no branch is added to the event
 * loop. Each one carries a mechanism no other kind has, because a store
 * whose only identity is its default sliders is a store the student can
 * rightly call a re-skinned service:
 *
 *   db           write lock contention (writes serialise against each other)
 *   objectstore  per-prefix rate ceilings and no queue (S3 SlowDown)
 *   searchindex  asynchronous indexing (a commit is not yet searchable)
 *   timeseriesdb two-class cost (cheap appends, expensive range queries)
 *   graphdb      traversal cost compounds with depth
 *   coldstorage  restore JOBS: flat multi-second latency, a slot quota,
 *                and no queue at all
 *   vectordb     recall target multiplies scan cost hyperbolically
 *
 * Five of them share one piece of machinery: a self-managed slot pool
 * whose per-request service cost is decided by the kind (a write pays an
 * indexing surcharge, a range query pays a scan surcharge, a deep traversal
 * multiplies, a high-recall vector query probes more of its index). The
 * engine's standard `startService` path draws every request's time from the
 * same distribution, so a kind whose whole lesson is "THIS class of request
 * costs more" must run its own admission and hand timing to serveWithin(),
 * exactly the way replica and shard already do.
 *
 * Determinism: every RNG draw here happens in classify(), once per admitted
 * request, unconditionally where a roll exists at all -- the same discipline
 * behaviour-data.ts follows, so replay never depends on a slider's value.

 * objectstore -- blob storage (S3-like)
 *
 * A wide flat-latency pool with one mechanism of its own: PER-PREFIX rate
 * ceilings. A blob store partitions its keyspace by prefix and each
 * partition sustains `prefixRps` on its own; a request that finds its
 * prefix over the ceiling is refused instantly with a SlowDown
 * ('throttled'), while the rest of the store idles. That is the S3 503,
 * and it is why blob-store performance advice is about key LAYOUT --
 * spread your prefixes -- rather than about capacity. The gate consumes
 * zero randomness (a continuous token bucket per prefix, refilled against
 * simulated time exactly like the rate limiter); requests that pass it
 * are served on the engine's ordinary wide slot pool.
 *
 * No instance model and no scaleField: it is a managed service, one
 * logical thing an autoscaler has no business resizing -- which is itself
 * part of the lesson, because when a prefix melts there is no "add
