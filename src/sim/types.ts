   *     controller moves. The stack and the controller's steps still line up
   *     exactly -- the controller adds 1 instance and the picture gains 1
   *     card -- but now they line up on the quantity the student meant.
   *
   *     perInstance is a WATERLINE, not a per-machine busy flag. The engine
   *     integrates one smoothed utilisation per node, not one per instance,
   *     and requests are dispatched to whichever slot is free -- instance 3
   *     has no identity that outlives a request. So `utilization * instances`
   *     busy-instance-equivalents are filled from index 0: full units read 1,
   *     one boundary unit carries the remainder, the rest read 0. A stack
   *     drawn from this shows "3 of 5 busy" truthfully without inventing
   *     per-machine state the simulation does not have.
   *
   *   shard
   *     ONE UNIT = ONE PARTITION. perInstance[i] is shard i's own smoothed
   *     utilisation -- genuinely independent numbers, because a partition
   *     has its own slots and its own backlog. This is the kind where the
   *     vector carries the whole lesson: with a hot key one entry pins at
   *     1.0 while the others sit near 0 and the node-level mean looks fine.
   *
   *   replica
   *     ONE UNIT = ONE MEMBER OF THE SET, ordered [primary, replica 0,
   *     replica 1, ...], so instances === replicaCount + 1. Index 0 is the
   *     primary and reports the WRITE pool's utilisation; the rest share the
   *     read pool's utilisation, which is the honest reading because a read
   *     is served by whichever replica is free and the engine pools them.
   *     Drawing the primary distinctly from the read set is the point: the
   *     write pool saturating while the read set idles is why adding read
   *     replicas does not fix a write bottleneck.
   *
   *   client, queue, autoscaler, region, ratelimiter, breaker
   *     NOT an instance model. These report `instances` undefined. A queue is
   *     a buffer (draw its depth against queueLimit), a breaker and a limiter
   *     are gates, an autoscaler and a region are controllers. Giving them a
   *     stack would say something false about what they are.
   *
   * A consumer must treat `instances === undefined` as "this kind is one
   * thing" and fall back to the scalar meters, never as "zero instances".
