/**
 * The briefs.
 *
 * Each one is an existing preset with a load and a goal attached, chosen so
 * that the design as it ships FAILS and a specific, findable change makes it
 * pass. A brief you pass without touching anything teaches nothing, and one
 * with no reachable answer teaches less than that.
 *
 * Every threshold here was measured against the engine, not estimated: the
 * failing number is what the preset actually does at that load, and the
 * passing one is what it does after the change named in the hint. They are
 * pinned by tests for the same reason the presets' own copy is, because a
 * brief that has drifted from the simulation is worse than no brief.
 *
 * Deliberately few. Four briefs that each teach a different thing beat
 * twenty that teach the same one, and the set is easier to keep honest.

    lesson:
      'A queue forms when work arrives faster than it can be served, and waiting in that queue is most of what a slow request is actually doing. The database was not slow: each request took the same time it always did. There were simply more of them than it had room for, so they waited their turn, and the waiting is what the reader felt as latency.',

    ],
    lesson:
      'Making the database bigger raised how much work one machine could take, and the errors did not move. They were requests turned away because every slot was occupied and the queue behind them was full, which more room per machine does not fix once the arrival rate is past what any single one can absorb. Running more of them does, because the work is shared rather than stacked. This is the difference between scaling up and scaling out, and it is why the second is what people reach for at this point.',

    brief:
      'At 150 requests a second this system is losing every single request. The database is working flat out the whole time, so it is not idle, and it is not broken. Work out where the load is coming from and make it serve traffic again.',

      'Either fewer attempts reach the database, or the database can take what arrives. Both are real answers, and they cost different things.',
    ],
    lesson:
      'The retries were not responding to the overload, they were causing it. Once queueing pushed the wait past the timeout, every request became three, so the load tripled onto something already full, which made the wait longer and produced more timeouts. That loop is why a retry storm collapses instead of levelling off, and why the database stayed pinned at full utilisation the whole time: the work was real, it was just being done for callers who had already given up.',

    lesson:
      'The database was never sized for the traffic, it was sized for the fraction the cache was leaving it. That is fine until the fraction changes, and it is why a cache is a performance decision with a capacity consequence hiding inside it: the hit rate is quietly part of your database sizing. Both fixes are legitimate and they buy different things. A warmer cache is cheaper and more fragile, since it fails the moment the hit rate drops. More database machines cost more and hold up whatever the cache does.',
