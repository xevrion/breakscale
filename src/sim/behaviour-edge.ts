/**
 * Edge-protection component behaviours: cdn, ratelimiter, breaker.
 *
 * These three are the layer that sits in FRONT of a system and decides what
 * ever reaches it. Grouped in their own module because they share a theme a
 * student can name -- "how do I stop load before it hurts me" -- and because
 * keeping them out of behaviour.ts keeps that file readable as the kind count
 * grows.
 *
 * Every one of them is a plain ComponentBehaviour: the event loop has no idea
 * they exist. None of them added a conditional to engine.ts.
 *
 * A note on determinism, which constrains all three. `advance(dt)` is driven
 * by wall-clock frames, so dt varies from frame to frame. Anything that
 * decides "has enough time passed?" therefore has to compare *simulated
 * timestamps*, never accumulate per-tick deltas -- otherwise the same seed
 * produces different results at a different frame rate. That is why the token
 * bucket refills against `now - lastRefillMs` and the breaker's state
 * transitions are evaluated lazily when a request arrives, rather than from
 * onTick.
